# Trivia Game

This is a trivia game which fetches questions from this API-https://jservice.io/api/random
The user types the answer and if the answer is correct, he scores points. If the answer is correct, the app fetches another question from the same API. I have used react router v6 and hooks for this project. I have used functional components and tried to keep it modular. There are no console errors.
